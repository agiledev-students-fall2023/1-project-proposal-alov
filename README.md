### Project title

Culinary Quest

### What and why?

This semester, I am proposing to build an application that recommends personalized recipes to users based on a series of questions. The problem this system addresses is the challenge many individuals face daily: deciding what to cook. With infinite recipe choices available, it's often overwhelming for individuals to make a choice tailored to their preferences, available ingredients, dietary restrictions, desired preparation time, etc. The importance of solving this problem lies in simplifying the decision-making process and potentially introducing users to new dishes they haven't tried before.

### For whom?

The software targets a broad audience which includes:

1. Home cooks looking for inspiration.
2. Individuals with dietary restrictions searching for tailored recipes.
3. Busy students and professionals who want quick meal suggestions based on their available pantry items.
4. People looking to try new cuisines or dishes but are unsure where to start.
   
For the initial phase, I can engage friends and family who fall into the categories mentioned to serve as the primary end-users. This will provide a solid base of feedback while also ensuring that the application meets the needs of real-world users.

### How?

1. Users will be welcomed to the homepage where a brief explanation of the application is presented.
2. They will then be prompted to answer a series of questions such as their dietary restrictions, preferred cuisines, available ingredients, and desired prep/cooking time.
3. Upon submission, the system will analyze their responses and recommend a set of recipes that closely match their criteria.
4. Users can then view the full recipe, save it for later, or get alternate suggestions if they are not happy with the recommendation.

### Scope

Given the outlined proposal, the project is appropriately scoped for a group of 4 - 6 programmers in one semester. The primary functionalities include a questionnaire module, a database to store recipes, a recipe recommendation algorithm, and a user-friendly interface. Because there is a clear division of tasks that can be worked on simultaneously—UI/UX, backend development, database management, and algorithm development—each team member can focus on specific areas, which will therefore ensure efficient progress.
